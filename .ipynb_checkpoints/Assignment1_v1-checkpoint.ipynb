    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- Performance with scale of data: Deep learning algorithms need a large amount of data to understand it perfectly whereas machine learning algorithms with their handcrafted rules prevails with limited data.\n",
    "- Feature Engineering: In Machine learning most of the features need to be identified by an expert and then hand-coded as per teh data type and requirement whereas deep learning algorithms try to learn high-level features from data itself thus  reduces the task of developing new feature extractor for every problem.\n",
    "- Data presentation: Machine learning requires structured data but with deep learning structured data isn’t necessary. In DL the system works with multi-layer neural networks that combine different algorithms and can process unstructured data.\n",
    "- Training: Machine learning requires training phase with human feedback whereas deep learning is self learning system.\n",
    "- Applications: ML is used in simple routine activities whereas DL is used for complex tasks.\n"
