Consider a Deep Feed Forward Network, of the type shown on Page 16 of Lecture 4 Slides,composed of an Input Layer with 10 nodes, followed by a Hidden Layer with 50 nodes and finally an Output Layer with 3 nodes.

The MNIST_Fashion dataset comes with Keras, and can be loaded using the commands: fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data() This dataset corresponds to grayscale coded images of various clothing items.

    "### 4. The figure above shows an example of Ensemble Processing (see Lecture 4). Start with the best model that you have after doing Problem 3, and replicate that model 3 times in a parallel configuration as shown in the figure (use the Keras Functional API for doing this). Take the final logit nodes from each branch and average it to create the final logit layer for the model (see https://keras.io/api/layers/merging_layers/average/ on how to do this). Train the model again on the fashion_mnist dataset, and check for an improvement in prediction accuracy (if any).<img src=\"imgs/hw2-Q4.jpg\"><br><br>(5 Points)"
