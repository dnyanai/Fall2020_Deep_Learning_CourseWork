    "### 2. Consider a Deep Feed Forward Network, of the type shown on Page 16 of Lecture 4 Slides,composed of an Input Layer with 10 nodes, followed by a Hidden Layer with 50 nodes and finally an Output Layer with 3 nodes. Assume the activation function f is given by ReLU, and the output function h is given by Softmax.<br><ul><li>a.  Compute the number of parameters (weights and biases) required to describe the network.</li><br><li>b. Write a Python program to do a forward pass through the network. Assume that the input training sample X = (0.5, 0.6, 0.1, 0.25, 0.33, 0.9, 0.88, 0.76, 0.69, 0.95). Also assume that all the weights and biases are initialized according to a Uniform distribution between [0,0.1]</li><br><li>c. Assuming that the output Label corresponding to X, is T = (1, 0, 0). Using the results of part (b), compute the Cross Entropy Loss Function.In order to verify the forward pass, the Loss Function should compute to log(3),explain why.</li><br><li>d. Write a Python program to do a backward pass through the network, and compute all the delta values.</li><br><li>e. Finally extend the Python program to compute the new weight parameters using stochastic gradient descent.<br>In order to verify that the algorithm has been coded correctly, you can do the following: Put the forward and backward passes in a loop (with the single training sample given in Part (b) and the corresponding Label in Part (c)). After several iterations you should see the Loss Function go to zero (explain why).</ul><br><br>(15 points)"
